# Command: vanish
Usage: `vanish`
Cooldown: 180s
Special: Halfling race only

The vanish command is a special racial cooldown available only to halflings.
When executed the `vanished` buff will be applied to the player and to all other
players they will seem to have vanished into thin air.

If the playr is currently engaged in combat then battle will be ended similar in
a similar fashion to that of the `flee` command, with the exception that there
is no chance of failure and no movement occurs. The `vanished` buff will be
removed if the player takes any action that reveals its location (e.g. moving,
attacking, speaking, etc.).
