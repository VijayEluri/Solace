# Skill: Light Armor (spe/vit)
The light-armor skill allows the character to effectively defend against attacks
when wearing light armor (e.g. hides, leathers, etc.).

## Passive Enhancements:
The light-armor skill provides the following passive enhancements when a
character wears only equipment that constitutes as light armor:

* [Level 10] `Tough as Leather`
  The character is granted a 5% to 15% damage resistance to physical damage
  (bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing) when wearing only light armor.
* [Level 25] `Second Hide`
  The character is granted a 15% armor class bonus for light armor worn on the
  head, body, and hands. Further, they are granted an additional 1% to 10%
  resistance to fire damage (resistance scales based on skill level).
* [Level 35] `Inner Warmth`
  The character is granted a 15% armor class bonus for light armor worn on the
  waist and legs. Further, they are granted an additional 1% to 10% resistance
  to cold damage (resistance scales based on skill level).
* [Level 45] `Fleet of Foot`
  The character is granted a 15% armor class bonus for light-armor worn on the
  feet. Furthermore, the character is granted an additional 1% to 10% bonus to
  the Speed ability (bonus scales with skill level).
* [Level 65] `Longevity`
  Increases the duration of all buffs from 10-20% (increase is based on skill
  level) if the character is wearing all light-armor.
* [Level 75] `Hasty Recovery`
  Reduces the duration of all debuffs from 10-20% (reduction based on skill
  level) if the character is wearing all light-armor.
* [Level 85] `Light Armor Mastery`
  The character gains a 25% bonus to AC for wearing only light-armor.
* [Level 100] `Center of One`
  Every time the character misses on an attack or a cooldown there is a 10%
  chance that the check will be remade and possibly succeed (chance increases
  with skill level).
