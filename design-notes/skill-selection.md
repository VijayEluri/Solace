# Notes: Character Skill Selection / Synergies

## Primary Attack Skills
If a player has any of these skills then it really only makes sense for them to
have 1 as the passives and cooldowns are only active if the player is weilding
the appropriate weapon type. The only reason why I could see a player wanting
to have more than one is to switch between combat styles (perhaps one-handed for
Tanking in a party and two-handed for DPS).

- One-handed
- Ranged
- Two-handed
- Unarmed

## Cooldown Attack Skills
These skills can act as a substitute for a primary attack skill but rely on the
clever use of cooldown rotations to push the same kind of damage. While not
mutually exclusive with primary attack skills, it can be complicated to find an
optimal damage output scheme as many primary attack skills also rely on cooldown
actions to maximize damage output.

- Evocation

## Primary Defense Skills
These skills are going to be interesting to design as they do not function
exclusively like the primary attack skills. Ideally a character that wishes for
the highest level of versatility in their equipment would have, perhaps, two
of these skills and reap partial benefits from both. Having three on a character
seems ill advised.

I wonder if we design the skills such that they are primarily passive oriented
such that you get specific benefits from having a light-armor body piece for
example.

- Heavy Armor
- Light Armor
- Unarmored

## Cooldown Defense Skills

- Restoration: defensive buffs and healing spells
- Block: defense oriented passives (with bonuses for having a shield) and
  utility oriented attack cooldowns (minor damage with debuffs for opponents)

## Utility Oriented Skills (Both Offensive & Defensive)

- Alteration: defensive, offensive, and utility buffs
- Persuasion: crowd control cooldowns, bartering and general utility passives
- Ranging:
- Stealth: a grab bag of stealth oriented offensive and defensive passives,
  buffs, and utility/attack cooldowns
