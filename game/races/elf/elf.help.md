# Elf
Aloof and beautiful; connected but detached. Elves are beings born of the fey
and share a special connection with all that is natural. In general, elven
societies can be relatively secluded and xenophobic but there are all sorts of
personalities when it comes to the elven folk (especially those with the hunger
for adventure). With their keen minds and regenerative capabilities elves can
make for formidable foes and steadfast allies.

Starting at level 1, elven characters come with the following racial bonuses:

- Racial Passive: `Meditation`
  Elves heal SP and MP 25% faster than all other races.
- Racial Cooldown: `Concentrate` (120s)
  Applies the "concentration" buff for 10s. While under the effects of the buff
  any cooldown used or spell cast will land with double potency.
