# Skill: Evocation (mag/spe)
The evocation skill allows a character to cast spells that manipulate the four
elements: ice, fire, lightning, and earth. Primarily an offense oriented skill
the spells gained through mastery of the evocation skill can, when deftly used,
bring even the mightiest foes to their knees.

For students wishing to gain further master of the evocation school need look
no further than the grimoire "Liber Particularum Magicae" (though finding a copy
may be no small feat as it has been out of print for three centuries).

## Spells:
