# Damage Types, Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities
Damage comes in a variety of forms, whether it be slashing damage from a
scimitar or cold damage from a spell. Broadly speaking there are two major
groups of damage: "Physical" and "Magic". Physical damage tends to be dealt by
weapons, while magical damage by spells and cooldowns.

Player characters can gain resistances to certain types of damage based on their
race, skills, and armor. These resistances reduce the overall damage taken when
hit by an attack of a specific damage type. Mobiles (NPCs, monsters, etc.) have
a wide variety of resistances to different damage types.

In the most extreme cases some monsters have immunities to certain damage types
(e.g. ice elementals are immune to `cold`) while others may be vulnerable to
different types and take more damage (e.g. undead are vulnerable to `radiant`).

## Physical Damage Types

* `bludgeoning`: blunt force damage caused by weapons that smash into
  opponents (hammers, maces, fists, etc).
* `piercing`: penetrating damage cause by weapons that stick into or bore
  through an opponent's flesh or armor (daggers, spears, etc.).
* `slashing`: slicing damage caused by weapons that cut, rip, or lash across an
  enemy's flesh or armor (swords, axes, whips, etc)

## Magical Damage Types

* `acid`: Corrosive damage that eats away at armor and flesh.
* `cold`: Cold or ice damage that freezes enemies.
* `fire`: Heat or flame damage that burns an opponent.
* `force`: Magical damage that pushes, presses, or throws enemies.
* `lightning`: Electrical damage that shocks opponents.
* `necrotic`: Damage that rots away living things.
* `poison`: Toxic damage that attacks the natural functions of one's body.
* `psychic`: Damage that attacks the mental fortitude of an opponent.
* `radiant`: Righteous / good damage that penetrates and burns an opponent.
* `unholy`: Vile / evil damage that viciously consumes an opponent.
