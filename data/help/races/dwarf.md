# Dwarf
Stocky and sometimes brutish, no other race encapsulates the solid will of the
earth than that of dwarves. While varied in appearance, dwarves tend to be made
of tougher stuff than individuals of other races. This reflects in their natural
ability to take more blows and dole back in return with twice the force.

Starting at level 1, dwarven characters come with the following racial bonuses:

- Racial Passive: Stout Hearted (`stout-hearted`)
  Dwarves receive a 10% bonus to the Vitality ability. This bonus applies after
  all other additive bonuses (e.g. equipment, buffs) have been applied.
- Racial Cooldown: `Skullknock` (180s)
  Bashing attack at potency 150 that stuns a single target for 4 seconds.
