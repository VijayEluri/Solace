# Solace Help System
Welcome, and thank you for using the Solace MUD help system. The system is an
interface to a vast number of topics ranging from general gameplay to specific
tactics.

To access a specific page use the `help <name>` command. If a page with the
given name was not found, the help system will search across all pages to find
a list of results that most closely match the query.

To use the search engine directly use the `help-search <query>` command. This
will search all help pages in the game and return a ranked list of up to ten
pages that best match your query.
