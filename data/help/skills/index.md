# Skills
A skill encompasses a general category of actions regarding an aspect of
warfare, crafting, or manipulation in the game world. Every skill has a level
from 1 to 100 which indicates a character's proficiency.

Skills provide characters with access to weapon and armor proficiencies, provide
passive enhancements, unlock cooldown actions, and provide additional commands
that can be used to manipulate the game world.

Finally, each skill is associated with two ability scores that have an
additional effect on how well the character performs skill actions, and how
effective passive enhancements are.

* `unarmed` - unarmed combat and martial arts fighting
* `one-handed` - one-handed weapon fighting (daggers, longswords, etc.)

* `unarmored` - proficiency in wearing little or no armor (e.g. robes, etc.)
* `light-armor` - light armor proficiency (e.g. leathers, hides, etc.)
* `heavy-armor` - heavy armor proficiency (e.g. plate, scale, etc.)
* `block` - actions and passives that increase shield skill and utility

* `stealth` - sneaking, hiding, and general rogue-like actions
* `persuasion` - fast talking, better bartering, and tricking enemies
* `ranging` - tracking, wilderness survival, and leveraging nature

* `evocation` - magics related to the control and manipulation of the elements
* `restoration` - magics to restore, heal, cure, and protect
