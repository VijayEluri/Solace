# Skill: Block (str/vit)
The block skill allows the character to effectively use a shield in battle thus
reducing the amount of damage taken over time and providing utility attacks that
negatively effect an opponent.

## Passive Enhancements:

* [Level 5] `Deflect`
  When wearing a shield you have a 5-15% chance of deflecting blows and avoiding
  an attack entirely (chance increases with skill level).
* [Level 30] `Shield Mastery`
  The character is granted a 10-25% bonus to AC for wearing a shield (bonus
  scales with skill level).
* [Level 50] `Defender`
  When wearing a shield, the character receives a 5-20% damage resistance to
  bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage (resistance scaled with skill
  level).
* [Level 100] `Reflect`
  When wearing a shield the character has a 10% chance of completely nullifying
  an incoming attack and reflecting the damage back on the attacker.

## Cool Down Actions:

* [Level 10] `Bash` (12s cooldown, 5% SP)
  When wearing a shield the character bashes an opponent dealing 50 potency
  bludgeoning damage. On a successful hit, there is a 10-30% chance that the
  opponent is given the `stunned` debuff for 4s (chance increases with skill
  level).
* [Level 25] `Topple` (16s cooldown, 10% SP)
  When wearing a shield the character performs an attack dealing 150 potency
  bludgeoning damage. On a successful hit, there is a 10-40% chance that the
  opponent is given the `prone` debuff for 6s (chance increases with skill
  level).
* [Level 65] `Throat Smash` (60s cooldown, 10% SP)
  When wearing a shield the character turns it sideways and chops it into the
  opponent's throat dealing 200 potency bludgeoning damage and applying the
  `silenced` debuff for 4s.
* [Level 85] `Pin` (120s cooldown, 25% SP)
  When wearing a shield, the character dashes forward and pins an opponent to a
  nearby wall or surface. This deals 300 potency bludgeoning damage and applies
  the `stunned` debuff for 8s.
