# Solace Help System
Welcome, and thank you for using the Solace MUD help system. The system is an
interface to a vast number of topics ranging from general gameplay to specific
tactics.

The help system indexes articles by keyword, to access help on a particular
aspect of the game simply type: `help <keywords>` and the system will do its
best to guide you.

To get started why not see the list of available commands? To do so simpy type
`help commands`.
