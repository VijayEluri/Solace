# Commmand: hotbar
Usage: `hotbar [slot] [command]`

The hotbar feature allows players to assign action macros to the number row keys
(1-9, 0, - and =). Once assigned a player need only enter the single character
command to execute the action.

For example, the `icespike` command from the evocation skill can be assigned to
the hotbar slot '1' by using: `hotbar 1 icespike`. This eases the execution of
common battle commands and makes it easier to focus on the action.

Entering `hotbar` without arguments will display the actions currently assigned
for each available slot.
