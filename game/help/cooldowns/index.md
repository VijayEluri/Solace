# Cooldowns
In addition to `commands`, cooldowns are the core action mechanic in the game.
Most `skills` grant a number of `cooldowns` that can be used to turn the tide
in battle, cast protective spells, and even heal others.

An exhaustive list of cooldowns is outside the scope of this article, but many
of the more common ones are referenced in the pages for `skills` and `races`.
