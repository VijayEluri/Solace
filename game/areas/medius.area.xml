<!--
	Medius is the central city of the game world. It is a relatively large city
	that is known for its temples, trade houses, unique stone architecture and
	also for its three awe inspiring obelisks: Equitas, Otium, and Prosperitas.
	There are three major districts in the city, each named after the obelisk
	around which they are centered.

	The city rests against a bay known as the "Median Bay". The Imbrium river
	runs through the center of the prosperity district. Along with two major
	aqueducts that run water from the mountains from the north and south this
	river supplies much of the city's fresh water.
