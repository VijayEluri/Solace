# Ability: Vitality
The vitality (vit) ability score determines a character's overall heartiness in
the game world. Vitality is directly tied to a character's maximum hit points
and is also used in a variety of other contexts:

* Character's resistance to poisons and diseases
* How long a character can survive in hostile environments
* How quickly hp, mp, and sp regenerate
* Damage and hit chance for skills that are vitality based

The vitality ability is very useful for characters who need a high amount of hp
or wish to focus in skills and spells that are based in vitality. Any character
can consider raising vitality to make it easier to explore hostile realms and
to raise overall survivability.
