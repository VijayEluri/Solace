# Human
Humans are the major inhabitants of the game world. Because they are so diverse
they come in a variety of superficial forms (shapes, sizes, and otherwise). The
one common trait of humans is that they are surprisingly adept generalists and
have a knack for surviving situations that boggle the mind.

Starting at level 1, humans characters come with the following racial bonuses:

- Racial Passive: `Generalist`
  Humans get a 5% bonus to all checks.
- Racial Cooldown: `Survivor` (300s)
  Immediately heal 50% HP and SP.
