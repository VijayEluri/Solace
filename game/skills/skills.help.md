# Skills
A skill encompasses a general category of actions regarding an aspect of
warfare, crafting, or manipulation in the game world. Every skill has a level
from 1 to 100 which indicates a character's proficiency.

Skills provide characters with access to weapon and armor `proficiencies`,
provide `passive enhancements`, unlock `cooldown` actions, and provide
additional commands that can be used to manipulate the game world.

Finally, each skill is associated with two `ability scores` that have an
additional effect on how well the character performs skill actions, and how
effective passive enhancements are.

## Weapons
* `unarmed`     (spe/vit) - unarmed combat and martial arts fighting
* `one-handed`  (str/spe) - enables the use of daggers, longswords, etc.
* `two-handed`  (str/vit) - grants the use of great swords, hammers, etc.
* `ranged`      (spe/str) - enables the use of bows, guns, etc.

## Armor
* `unarmored`   (spe/str) - proficiency in wearing little or no armor
* `light-armor` (spe/vit) - light armor (leather, hide, etc.)
* `heavy-armor` (vit/str) - heavy armor (plate, scale, etc.)
* `block`       (str/vit) - increased utility with shields

## Magic
* `evocation`   (mag/spe) - controls the elements
* `restoration` (vit/mag) - mends wounds, cures poisons, and protects
* `alteration`  (mag/str) - changes the state of physical reality
* `necromancy`  (mag/vit) - manipulates both life and death
* `conjuration` (str/mag) - summons items and beings

## Utility
* `stealth`     (spe/str) - sneaking, hiding, and other rogue-like actions
* `persuasion`  (spe/vit) - fast talking, bartering, and subterfuge
* `ranging`     (vit/mag) - tracking, survival, and nature abilities
