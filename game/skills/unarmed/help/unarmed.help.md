## Cooldown Actions:
The unarmed skill provides the following cooldown actions when a character
wields no weapons at the given skill level:

* [Level 15] `Manipura Palm` (GCD, 5% SP)
  Drawing upon power from flame chakra the player performs a sudden palm attack
  dealing potency 125 `fire` damage to an opponent. On a successful hit the
  player receives a single stack of the `prana vayu` buff for 6s (up to a
  maximum of 3 stacks).
* [Level 35] `Apana Vayu` (18s cooldown, 20% SP)
  Reversing the energy flow within the body, the player releases two stacks of
  the `prana vayu` buff to deal potency 400 `force` damage to an opponent. Note
  that this cooldown cannot be activated unless the player has at least two
  stacks of the `prana vayu` buff.
* [Level 50] `Samana Strike` (GCD, 10% SP)
  Through focus the player increases their metabolic rate and channels the extra
  energy into a strike dealing potency 175 `force` damage to an opponent. On a
  successful hit the player also gains a stack of the `samana vayu` buff for 6s
  (up to a maximum of 3 stacks).
* [Level 75] `Vyana Vayu` (36s cooldown, 40% SP)
  By swiftly converting metabolic energy into kinetic force the player sheds
  two stacks of `smana vayu` and performs an attack dealing 800 `force` damage
  to an opponent. Note that this cooldown cannot be activated unless the player
  has at least two stacks of the `samana vayu` buff.
* [Level 100] `Prana Beam` (72s cooldown, 25% HP + 50% SP)
  The player channels their very life force into a potency 1400 `force` damage
  attack against an opponent. The attack requires 3 stacks of the `prana vayu`
  buff and 3 stacks of `smana vayu` buff to activate, after which all stacks of
  both buffs are shed from the player.
