# Races
Races determine the look and feel of characters in the game world. Each race
comes equipped with a specialized `passive ability` and `cooldown` command that
each work well with in conjunction with different types of skill builds for a
character.

The game races are as follows:

* `human` - A hearty race that works well for generalist builds.
* `elf` - Thin a beautiful, elves draw energy from the nature surrounding them.
* `drawf` - Thick and sturdy, dwarves can take a beating and dole one out.
* `gnome` - A small and spritelike race that's specifically attuned to magic.
* `halfling` - Small and quick with amazing reflexes and control.
