# Command: look
Usage: `look [target]`

The look command is used to get a description for a room, character, item, or
anything else in the game world. On its own the command gives you the
description of the current room you are in. When used with the optional target
parameter it will give you the description of anything in the room that has a
name that matches the given target.
