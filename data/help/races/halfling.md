# Halfling
Halfings are distant relation to what they call the "big folk" (`humans`). At
some point in the past the two races diverged. While humans spread throughout
the known world further generalizing their skills, halflings originally nestled
themselves upon a string a small islands known as the "lost homes". Their forms
reflect their surroundings having grown small to accommodate the lack of
resource and growing incredibly dexterous by having to avoid being eaten by what
the traditional halfling tales call the "cunning menace".

Starting at level 1, halfling characters come with the following racial bonuses:

- Racial Passive: Light Footed
  Halflings receive a 10% bonus to the Speed ability. This bonus applies after
  all other additive bonuses (e.g. equipment, buffs) have been applied.
- Racial Cooldown: Vanish (180s)
  Immediately vanish from sight and become hidden until attacking, moving, or
  interacting in any way that would cause you to be detected. When used while
  fighting the battle will immediately stop because the target loses sight of
  you.
