# Magic Points (MP)
Magic Points (MP) determine the overall well of magical engergy available to
a character. Spells generally require a specific MP cost in order to be cast.
Furthermore some effects such as skills, spells, and equipment can have an
impact on a character's current MP.

Current MP is restored over time as the character plays and can be hastened by
putting the character into specific states (resting, sleeping, medidating,
etc.). Some potions and skills can also restore a character's current MP.

A character's maximum MP increases by leveling and can be effected both
negatively and positively by actions such as spells, or by items such as
magical equipment.
