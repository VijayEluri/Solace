# Ability Stats
The following stats:

* Strength (str)
* Magic (mag)
* Vitality (vit)
* Speed (spe)

are known as ability stats, and determine a character's aptitude in one
particular aspect of the game. These stats are used to determine how powerful
attacks are, how often they miss, base `hp` and `mp`, and a multitude of other
character aspects in the game.

Each of the stats naturally grows as a character levels and can be augmented
through the use of enchantments, potions, equipment,and blessings.

For more information on exactly how each of the stats effects game play see the
help article for that stat by using the `help [name]` command (where [name] is
one of strength, magic, vitality, or speed).
