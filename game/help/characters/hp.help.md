# Hit Points (HP)
Hit Points (HP) are a resource stat that determines how much overall damage a
character can withstand before passing out (and eventually dying). Characters
have both a maximum number of HP, and a current number of HP.

Taking any sort of damage, physical or otherwise, depletes a character's current
HP. Furthermore, certain player actions (e.g. spells and skills) require a HP
cost to activate (think blood magic or taijutsu).

Like all resource stats HP naturally regenerates at a fixed rate over time.
Certain states such as sleeping and resting, and certain rooms designated as
healing temples will cause characters to heal more quickly. Additionally there
are items such as potions, and spells that can restore a player's HP.
