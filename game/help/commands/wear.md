# Command: wear
Usage `wear [item-name]`

The wear command allows a character to don a piece of a equipment currently
held in their inventory. The equipment is placed automatically into the
appropriate equipment slot and is removed from the character's inventory.

If another item is already occupying the slot for the given item, it will be
replaced with the new item and then placed in the character's inventory.
