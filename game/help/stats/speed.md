# Ability: Speed
The speed (spe) ability determines a character's overall quickness and dexterity
when interacting with the game world. Speed has effects in the game over many
contexts including:

* Character's chance to evade attacks
* How adept the character is as certain skills (lockpicking, sneaking, etc.)
* The overall damage and hit chance for skills based in speed
* Higher speeds reduce the sp cost of movement

Characters who wish to be stealthy or agile in the game will want to focus on
developing their speed stat. Any character may choose speed as it allows them
to travel for longer distance without rest and reduces the overall damage taken
by physical attacks.
