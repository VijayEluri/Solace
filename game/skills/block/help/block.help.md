# Skill: Block (str/vit)
The block skill allows the character to effectively use a shield in battle thus
reducing the amount of damage taken over time. Note that some passive
enhancements and actions can be used with two handed weapons, but at a penalty.

## Passive Enhancements:

- [5] Deflect
  When wearing a shield you have a chance of deflecting blows and taking
  significantly less damage. The chance increases with skill level.

- [40] Defender
  Decreases all incoming physical damage when wearing a shield. The amount of
  the reduction scales with skill level.

- [100] Reflect
  When wearing a shield you have a chance of completely nullifying an incoming
  attack and reflecting the damage back on the attacker.

## Cool Down Actions:

- [10] Bash
  Bash the opponent with your shield dealing 50% attack damage with a chance to
  stun them for a number of rounds.

- [25] Topple
  Deflect a blow from the opponent toppling them to the ground, this leaves the
  opponent prone for one round.

- [65] Throat Smash
  Turning her shield sideways the character chops it into the opponent's throat
  dealing a full attack and silencing the opponent for a number of turns.

- [100] Pin
  Dashing forward the character pins an opponent to a nearby wall or surface for
  a number of turns. While pinned the opponent is unable to take any actions but
  can still be attacked and take damage.
