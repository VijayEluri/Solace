# Skill: Evocation (mag/spe)
The evocation skill allows a character to cast spells that manipulate the four
elements: ice, fire, lightning, and earth. Primarily an offense oriented skill
the spells gained through mastery of the evocation skill can, when deftly used,
bring even the mightiest foes to their knees.

According to contemporary scholars an ancient grimoire by the name of "Liber
Particularum Magicae" exists on the subject of evocation mastery. It is rumored
that its pages contain deep unknown truths of the elements along with a plethora
of strategies and synergies crafted by the greatest arch-mages of yore. Finding
a complete copy of the tome, however, may prove no small feat.
