A running list of all passive hooks we'd need to have in the game engine to
allow for the scripting of all passive enhancements that are granted by skills
and races.

* Number of Weapon Attacks
* Attack Evasion
* Ability Scores
* Base HP, SP, and MP recovery
* Cooldown Potency

* Advanced pet skills unlock
* Pet bonuses
* As a result of debuff damage
* On skill use ('Mass Effect' from restoration)
