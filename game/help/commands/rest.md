# Command: rest
Usage: `rest`

The rest command allows a player to begin resting, which increases the rate at
which resources regenerate. While not as an effective regeneration as sleeping,
resting allows a player to remain aware of their surroundings. This can be
useful in social situations, or in dangerous areas where players may need to
keep an eye out for trouble. Players can exit the resting state by using the
`stand` command.
