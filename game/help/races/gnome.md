# Gnome
Gnomes are mysterious race who's origin is shrouded in mystery. Some tales say
they were once elves who were transformed into their current shape by a long
dead goddess of magic. Others tales tell of the first gnomes being born out of
the passion of magic itself. Wherever they hail from their delicate form and
mesmerizing eyes tell of their innate connection to magic and all things
magical.
