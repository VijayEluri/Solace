# Passive Enhacements (Passives)
Passive enhancements are a type of ability granted to character that apply a
continual benefit. For the most part, passives are granted by `skills` and
`races` and can have effects ranging from increasing the number of attacks a
player makes to making them heal at a faster rate.

The passives a character currently has can be listed using the passives command
(see `cmd-passives`).
