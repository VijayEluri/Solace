# Buffs and Debuffs
Buffs and debuffs are temporary effects that can be applied to characters that
help and hinder respectively. They can be applied in a variety of ways including
but not limited to: cooldowns, spells, potions, scrolls, and even by some by
paying specific mobiles.

Buffs and debuffs can be temporary in two fundamental ways. The first, and most
common are buffs that last for a specified amount of time. The second, less
common type, are buffs that last until some triggered action has occurred.
Further, there is no set standard on how long a buff or debuff can last. It is
highly variable from source to source (e.g. a high quality invisibility potion
might last much longer than a cheap knockoff).

There are a wide variety of effects that a buff or debuff can have on a player.
Here are a few beneficial "buff" examples:

- Add temporary maximum `hp`, `mp`, or `sp`
- Boost attack bonuses
- Reduce incoming damage
- Make a player invisible

And a few more detrimental "debuff" examples:

- Slowly drain `hp` over time
- Paralyze a player
- Drain player levels
- Reduce an ability stat

A full list of buffs and debuffs in the game is outside the scope of this page.
Please see the help articles `buff-list` and `debuff-list` for a full listing of
each type and links to further help articles.
