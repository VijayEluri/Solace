# Ability: Magic
The magic (mag) ability score determines a character's natural aptitude towards
spell casting. The mag score directly impacts a character's maximum `magic points`
and is used is used in many contexts in the game:

* Effectiveness of cast spells
* Magical defense against hostile spells
* How competent the character is handling magical items
* The strength of brewed potions and some poisons

The mag ability is very useful for characters who wish to focus their efforts
in the arcane arts (spell casting, potion making, etc.). Any character may wish
to develop their mag to a certain degree as it helps to protect against hostile
spells and mitigate damage therein.
