# Stats
Stats represent a character's overall aptitude in one aspect of the game. There
are two types of stats:

* Resource Stats - HP, MP, SP
* Ability Stats - Strength, Magic, Vitality, Speed

The resource stats are used as pools of power upon which a character can draw
to perform certain actions (e.g. surviving a hit, casting a spell, or performing
a skill). For more details on resource stats see `help resource`.

Ability stats determine how proficient or powerful the character is when
performing certain actions such as spells and skills. For more information
please see `help ability`.

There are help entries for each of the seven stats, to see those pages use
`help <name>` where <name> is the name of stat (hp, mp, sp, strength, magic,
vitality, or speed).
