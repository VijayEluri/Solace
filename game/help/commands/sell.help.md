# Command: sell
Usage: `sell [item-name]`

The sell command allows players to sell items of value in their inventory to
shops in the game world. Shops will usually buy items at a considerable
markdown, so cavet empor!

Make sure to use the `appraise` command to check if the selling price before
selling valuable items.
