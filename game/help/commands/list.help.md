# Command: list
Usage: `list`

The list command allows players to list the items for sale in shops around the
game. A list is displayed that provides each for sale item's inventory number,
price, name, and quantity remaining.

Items that have an unlimited quantity are signified by "{m}--{x}", in the quantity
column. Items that have a limited quantity will display a number, and the total
quantity in stock will replenish over time. Note: all shops replenish stocks at
different times, rates, and probabilities, so keep an eye out for rare items in
shops.
