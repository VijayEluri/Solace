# Command: emote
Usage `emote [descriptive text]`

The emote command allows players to describe actions their characters are taking
from a role play perspective. For instance, a character with the name "Smo"
using the emote command:

  emote danced the night away

would tell everyone in the room:

  Smo danced the night away.

and tell Smo:

  You danced the night away.

There are a fair bit of built-in automatic emote commands that you can use as
well. Here's a complete list:

  joey scowl
