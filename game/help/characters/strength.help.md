# Ability: Strength
The strength (str) ability score determines a character's raw physical prowess.
A character's str score is used in many ways by the game, here are a few
examples:

* Damage done by a physical attack
* How much a character can carry in their inventory
* Damage and hit chance for skills that are strength based (see `help skills`)
* How adept the character is when forging weapons and armor

The str ability is particularly useful for characters who focus primarily on
physical attacks that do not require stealth. All characters will want to spend
some amount of time developing their strength, as it makes it easier to carry
more items and wear heavier equipment.
