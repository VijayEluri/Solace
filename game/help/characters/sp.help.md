# Stamina Points (SP)
Stamina Points (SP) represent a character's level of energy before reaching
exhaustion. Skills generally require some cost in SP to be executed, but some
spells and effects can also deplete SP.

Like all resource stats SP has a current value and a maximum value. The current
value is naturally restored over time and can be hastened by sleeping, resting,
or being in a special healing temple room. The maximum SP value increases by
leveling and can be effected positively and negatively by potions and spells.
