# Command: sleep
Usage: `sleep`

The sleep command puts the character to sleep allowing for a dramatic increase
in the restoration of resources over time. This means that hit points, magic
points, and stamina points will all regenerate at a much quicker rate than when
standing, sitting, or resting.
